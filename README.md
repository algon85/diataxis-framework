# Diátaxis Framework (Reference Repository)

This repository exists to provide a **single, canonical explanation** of the **Diátaxis documentation framework** as it is used across my GitHub projects.

Rather than repeating explanations in every repository, this repo serves as the authoritative source for:
- What Diátaxis is
- Why it’s used
- What each documentation category is meant to accomplish

---

## How This Is Used

Many repositories under this GitHub account are structured using the Diátaxis framework:

- `tutorials/`
- `how-to/`
- `explanations/`
- `reference/`

If you encounter that structure and want to understand **why the documentation is organized this way**, start here.

## Start Here

- **[diataxis.md](./diataxis.md)** — A concise explanation of the Diátaxis framework and its four documentation types.

---

## Intent

This repository is **not** a tutorial on documentation writing, nor an exhaustive academic treatment of Diátaxis.

Its purpose is practical:
- To establish shared context for readers
- To make documentation structure predictable
- To keep individual project READMEs focused on the project itself
